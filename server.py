# RECO7609 Story Writer Webapp python backend server

#Prompt:

#Now I would like to implement a next word prediction functionality. Using a python written bigram model as the next word prediction model with provided story as the sample data, the webapp should be able to predict the next word that the user is going to write and display it in the "next word" box. If the user presses the "write" button without inputting any word in the input box, the predicted next word should be used as the input word. If the user did input a word in the input box, the user inputted word should be used as the input word. Please implement this without the use of any external library.

# Sample story data
sample_story = """
Once upon a time in a small village nestled between the mountains, there lived a young girl named Elara. She had a curious spirit and an insatiable desire for adventure. Every morning, she would wander into the lush forests that surrounded her home, dreaming of the magical creatures that might be hiding among the trees.

One sunny day, as Elara explored deeper into the woods than ever before, she stumbled upon a shimmering pond. The water sparkled like diamonds under the sunlight, and as she approached, she noticed a small, iridescent fish swimming gracefully. 

"Hello there," Elara called out, leaning closer. "What are you doing in this pond all alone?"

To her surprise, the fish leaped out of the water and spoke in a melodic voice, "I am not alone, dear girl. I am the guardian of this pond, and I grant wishes to those who are pure of heart."

Elara's eyes widened with wonder. "Really? Iâ€™ve always wanted to explore the world beyond my village. Can you help me?"

The fish nodded, its scales glinting. "If your heart is true and your intentions are noble, I will grant you one wish."

Elara thought for a moment, weighing her options. She could wish for riches, fame, or even the ability to fly. But deep down, she knew what she truly desired. 

"I wish to embark on an adventure that will help others," she declared boldly. 

With a flick of its tail, the fish created a burst of sparkling water that enveloped Elara. In an instant, she found herself standing in a bustling marketplace filled with people from all walks of life. 

As she looked around, Elara realized that her adventure had just begun. Each person she encountered had their own story, and she felt a deep urge to listen, to learn, and to lend a hand wherever she could. 

And so, with courage in her heart and a spirit ready for discovery, Elara set forth into the unknown, ready to make a difference in the world.
